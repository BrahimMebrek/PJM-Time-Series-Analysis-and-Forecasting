# PJM Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

### The visualizations are interactive and made with plotly, make sure to use Nbviewer to check out the notebook.

This notebook is a study of the **PJM** energy consumption dataset and focus on the **East** coast of the US, a friend of mine "Souames Anis" worked on a similar notebook targeting the West coast.

- Check out Anis work on : https://github.com/anis-coding/PJM-Time-Series-Analysis


It contains :

- An Exploratory Data Analysis.
- A Time Series Analysis through the concepts of Seasonality and Stationarity.
- A Time Series Forecasting using Facebook Prophet and XGBoost Models in order to predict future energy consumption.


**Data :** The dataset contains hourly data from 2002 upto 2018 on the power consumption from several companies including PJM, it's available on Kaggle
